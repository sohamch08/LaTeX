	Worked on \textit{Derandomization of Isolation Lemma over Polytopes}

    Guide: Dr. \href{https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~rgurjar/}{Rohit Gurjar}, IIT Bombay

    In this project I tried to extend the idea of bounding the number of vectors in the integer lattice which has $L_1$ norm less than twice the shortest vector for 0-1 matrices with $k$-column sum to derandomize isolation lemma over more general polytopes. Additionally I read about isolating a path connecting in a black-box layered graph.

\entry*[Dec'23-Jul'24]%
	Project on \textit{Quantum Property Testing of Junta Functions and Partially Symmetric Functions}

    Guide: Dr. \href{https://sites.google.com/site/homepagearijitghosh/}{Arijit Ghosh}, ISI Kolkata

    In this project I learned about Quantum Boolean Functions and some basics of Quantum algorithms for property testing from the Survey by \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2435}{Montanaro-Osborne, 2008}. I learned about Classical and Quantum Junta Function testing. We worked on finding a more efficient Quantum Algorithm for testing Paritally symmetric boolean functions by improving the classical algorithm in Blais-Weinstein-Yoshida's Paper.

\entry*[Summer 2023]%
	Reading project on \textit{Factorization of Arithmetic Circuits} 

    Guide: Dr. \href{https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nitin/}{Nitin Saxena}, IIT Kanpur

   In the project I learned factorization techniques and closure of of VP and VBP under factorization. I also read closure of VF with bounded individual degree from Oliviera, 2016 paper and we worked on removing the bounded individual degree condition
\entry*[Dec 2022]%
	Reading project on \textit{Computational Number Theroy and Algebra for Algebraic Comlexity Theory } 

    Guide: Dr. \href{https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nitin/}{Nitin Saxena}, IIT Kanpur

   I did a basic study of Computational Number Theory and Algebra from Nitin Saxena's course and about Arithmetic Circuits from \href{https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/TCS-039}{Amir Shpilka's Survey} and \href{https://github.com/dasarpmar/lowerbounds-survey}{Ramprasad Saptharishi's Survey} on Arithmetic Circuits.
