	abstract = {The iterated mod problem is this: given a, b1, b2, ..., bn, all integers or all polynomials in Q[x], is ((...((a mod b1) mod b2)...) mod bn) = 0? When the inputs are integers, we prove the problem P-complete with respect to log-space reductions, whereas in the polynomial case, we prove the problem is in NC. The significance of these results lies primarily in the similarity between the iterated mod problem and the Euclidean algorithm. We also show that the superincreasing knapsack problem is P-complete, using a very similar proof.}

	abstract = {We state and prove an expansion theorem for the determinant of any Hessenberg matrix. The expansion is expressed as a vector-matrix-vector product which can be efficiently evaluated on a parallel machine. We consider the computation of the first N terms of a sequence defined by a general linear recurrence. On a sequential machine this problem is $O(N^2 )$, with N processors it is $O(N)$,and with $O(N^4 )$ processors it is $O(log ^2 N)$ using our expansion. Other applications include locating roots of analytic functions and proving doubling formulas for linear recurrences with constant co-efficients.},

	abstract = {The existence of parallel and pipeline computers has inspired a new approach to algorithmic analysis. Classical numerical methods are generally unable to exploit multiple processors and powerful vector-oriented hardware. Efficient parallel algorithms can be created by reformulating familiar algorithms or by discovering new ones, and the results are often surprising. A comprehensive survey of parallel techniques for problems in linear algebra is given. Specific topics include: relevant computer models and their consequences for programs, evaluation of arithmetic expressions, solution of general and special linear systems of equations, and computation of eigenvalues.},
