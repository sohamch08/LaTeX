Map the common part of the disks $|z|<1$ and $|z-1|<1$ on the inside of the unit circle. Choose the mapping so that the two symmetries are preserved.
%Problem		
\end{problem}

\solve{
%Solution
Let $C_1:|z|=1$ and $C_2:|z-1|=1$. Let the common region between them is $\Om$
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \filldraw[red!30!white,opacity=0.6,draw=red] (0,0) circle (1cm) node[xshift=-1.2cm,yshift=4mm,color=red!80!black]{$\bmC_1$};
        \filldraw[blue!30!white,opacity=0.6,draw=blue] (1,0) circle (1cm) node[xshift=1.2cm,yshift=4mm,color=blue!80!black]{$\bmC_2$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-1.5,0) -- (4,0);
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,-1.2) -- (0,2);
        \draw (0.5,0) node[yshift=2mm,black]{$\Om$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The circles intersect when $$|z|=|z-1|\iff z\ovz=(z-1)(\ovz-1)\iff 1=z+\ovz$$Hence $ \Re(z)=\frac12$. Therefore $\Im(z)=\pm\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ since $|z|=1$. Therefore $C_1$ and $C_2$ intersects at $-\om$ and $-\om^2$.

Now we send $-\om^2\to \infty$ and $-\om\to 0$ by the conformal map $f_1(z)=\frac{z+\om}{z+\om^2}$. Then $$f_1(1)=\frac{1+\om}{1+\om^2}=\frac{-\om^2}{-\om}=\om\qquad f_1(0)=\frac{\om}{\om^2}=\frac1{\om}=\bar{\om}=\om^2$$ Hence $f_1(C_1)=$ line joining $0$ and $\om$ and $f_1(C_2)=$ line joining $0$ and $\om^2$
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \filldraw[red!30!white,opacity=0.6] (-1,1.732) -- (-1,-1.732) -- (1,-1.732);
        \filldraw[blue!30!white,opacity=0.6] ((1,1.732) -- (-1,1.732) -- (-1,-1.732);
        \draw[blue!80!black] ((1,1.732) node[xshift=4mm,color=blue!80!black]{$\bmC_2$} -- (-1,-1.732);
        \draw[red!80!black] (-1,1.732) -- (1,-1.732) node[xshift=4mm,color=red!80!black]{$\bmC_1$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-1.5,0) -- (4,0);
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,-2) -- (0,2);
        \draw (0,0) node[xshift=-5mm,yshift=2mm,black]{$\Om$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Now we rotate the region $\Om$ by $\frac{2\pi}{3}$ clockwise by the conformal map $f_2(z)=e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{3}}z=\om z$
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-1,0) -- (1,0);

        \filldraw[red!30!white,opacity=0.6] (1,0) -- (1,1.732) -- (-1,1.732) -- (-1,0);
        \filldraw[blue!30!white,opacity=0.6] (-1,1.732) -- (1,1.732) -- (1,-1.732);
        \draw[blue!80!black] (-1,1.732) -- (1,-1.732) node[xshift=4mm,color=blue!80!black]{$\bmC_2$};
        \draw[red!80!black] (-1,0) -- (1,0) node[xshift=-2.3cm,color=red!80!black]{$\bmC_1$};
        \draw (0.5,0) node[yshift=2mm,black]{$\Om$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,-2) -- (0,2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Now we map the common region $\Om$ to the upper half of the plane by the conformal map $f_3(z)=z^{\frac32}$
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \filldraw[red!30!white,opacity=0.6] (1,0) -- (1,1.732) -- (-1,1.732) -- (-1,0);
        \filldraw[blue!30!white,opacity=0.6] (1,0) -- (1,1.732) -- (-1,1.732) -- (-1,0);
        \draw (0.5,0) node[yshift=2mm,black]{$\Om$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,2) -- (0,-0.5);
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-1,0) -- (1,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Now we want to map the upper half plane to inside of the unit circle. We do it with the conformal map $f_4(z)=\frac{z-\om}{z-\om^2}$
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}

        \filldraw[red!30!white,opacity=0.6] (0,0) circle (1cm) ;
        \filldraw[blue!30!white,opacity=0.6] (0,0) circle (1cm);
        \draw (0.5,0) node[yshift=2mm,black]{$\Om$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,1.5) -- (0,-1.5);
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-1.5,0) -- (1.5,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}Hence the final conformal map which maps the region $\Om$ to the inside of unit disk is \begin{multline*}
    f_4\circ f_3\circ f_2\circ f_1(z)=f_4\circ f_3\circ f_2\lt(\frac{z+\om}{z+\om^2}  \rt)=f_4\circ f_3\lt( \om\frac{z+\om}{z+\om^2}\rt)=f_4\circ f_3\lt( \frac{\om^2z+1}{\om z+1}\rt)\\
    =f_4\lt( \lt[ \frac{\om^2z+1}{\om z+1} \rt]^{\frac32} \rt)=\frac{ \lt[ \frac{\om^2z+1}{\om z+1} \rt]^{\frac32}-\om}{ \lt[ \frac{\om^2z+1}{\om z+1} \rt]^{\frac32}-\om^2}
\end{multline*}

%Solution
Let $C_1:|z|=1$ and $C_2:\lt|z-\frac12\rt|=\frac12$. Let the common region between them is $\Om$
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \filldraw[red!30!white,opacity=0.6,draw=red] (0,0) circle (2cm) node[xshift=-2.4cm,yshift=4mm,color=red!80!black]{$\bmC_1$};
        \filldraw[blue!30!white,opacity=0.6,draw=blue] (1,0) circle (1cm) node[xshift=1.4cm,yshift=4mm,color=blue!80!black]{$\bmC_2$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-2.5,0) -- (2.5,0);
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,-2.5) -- (0,2.5);
        \draw (-0.5,0) node[yshift=2mm,black]{$\Om$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The two circles touch each other at $1$.

Now we send $1\to \infty$ and $0\to 0$ with the conformal map $f_1(z)=\frac{z}{z-1}$. Hence $$f_1(-1)=\frac{-1}{-1-1}=\frac12\qquad f_1\lt(\frac12\rt)=\frac{\frac12}{\frac12-1}=-1$$ $$f(i)=\frac{i}{i-1}=\frac{i(-i-1)}{2}=\frac12-\frac{i}2 \qquad f(-i)=\frac{-i}{-i-1}=\frac{i(1-i)}{2}=+\frac12+\frac{i}2$$Hence $f(C_1)=$ is the line parallel to imaginary axis passing through $\frac12$. $f(C_2)=$ imaginary axis. Hence the region $\Om$ is mapped to the $\frac12$ width strip parallel to imaginary axis enclosed between imaginary axis and $\Re(z)=\frac12$.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \filldraw[red!30!white,opacity=0.6] (1,2) -- (1,-2) -- (-2,-2) -- (-2,2);
        \filldraw[blue!30!white] (0,2) -- (0,-2) -- (-2,-2) -- (-2,2); %node[xshift=1.4cm,yshift=4mm,color=blue!80!black]{$\bmC_2$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-2,0) -- (2,0);
        \draw[red] (1,2) -- (1,-2) node[xshift=4mm,yshift=1cm]{$\bmC_1$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,-2) -- (0,2);
        \draw[blue] (0,2) -- (0,-2) node[xshift=-4mm,yshift=1cm]{$\bmC_2$};
        \draw (-0.5,0) node[xshift=1cm,yshift=2mm,black]{$\Om$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Now we rotate the region $\Om$ by $90^{\circ}$ counter clockwise with the conformal map $f_2(z)=iz$
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \filldraw[red!30!white,opacity=0.6] (2,1) -- (-2,1) -- (-2,-2) -- (2,-2);
        \filldraw[blue!30!white] (2,0) -- (-2,0) -- (-2,-2) -- (2,-2); %node[xshift=1.4cm,yshift=4mm,color=blue!80!black]{$\bmC_2$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-2,0) -- (2,0);
        \draw[red] (2,1) -- (-2,1) node[xshift=1cm,yshift=4mm]{$\bmC_1$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,-2) -- (0,2);
        \draw[blue] (2,0) -- (-2,0) node[xshift=1cm,yshift=-0.4cm]{$\bmC_2$};
        \draw (-0.5,0) node[xshift=1cm,yshift=4mm,black]{$\Om$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}Since the strip width is $\frac12$ we take the conformal map $f_3(z)=\lt(e^z\rt)^{\frac{\pi}{\frac12}}=\lt(e^z\rt)^{2\pi}=e^{2\pi z}$ which maps the strip of width $\frac12$ to the upper half plane.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \filldraw[red!30!white,opacity=0.6] (2,0) -- (-2,0) -- (-2,2) -- (2,2);
        \draw (0.5,0) node[yshift=4mm,black]{$\Om$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,2) -- (0,-0.5);
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-2,0) -- (2,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Hence the final conformal map which maps the region between the two circles $C_1$ and $C_2$ to the upper half plane is $$f_3\circ f_2\circ f_1(z)=f_3\circ f_2\lt( \frac{z}{z-1} \rt)=f_3\lt( i\frac{z}{z-1} \rt)=e^{\frac{2\pi iz}{z-1}}$$

\solve{
%Solution
Let $C:|z|=1$.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        %\filldraw[red!30!white] (-2,-1.5) -- (2,-1.5) -- (2,1.5) -- (-2,1.5);
        \filldraw[white,opacity=1,draw=red] (0,0) circle (1cm) node[xshift=-1.2cm,yshift=2mm,color=red!80!black]{$\bmC$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-1.5,0) -- (1.5,0);
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,-1.2) -- (0,1.2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

We map the semi arc containg $i$ to  the negative real axis  then ultimately to the right half plane.

We first map $1\to \infty$ and $-1\to 0$ with the conformal map $f_1(z)=\frac{z+1}{z-1}$. Then $$f(\infty)=1\quad f(i)=\frac{i+1}{i-1}=\frac{(i+1)(-1-i)}{2}=-i\quad f(-i)=\frac{-i+1}{-i-1}=\frac{(-i+1)(-1+i)}{2}=i$$Hence $f_1(C)=$ Imaginary axis
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        %\filldraw[red!30!white] (-2,-1.5) -- (2,-1.5) -- (2,1.5) -- (-2,1.5)
        \filldraw[white,opacity=1,draw=red] (0,0) circle (1cm) node[xshift=-1.2cm,yshift=2mm,color=red!80!black]{$\bmC$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-1.5,0) -- (1.5,0);
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,-1.2) -- (0,1.2);

        \draw[<->,very thin] (2.5,0) -- (5.5,0);
        \draw[<->,very thin,red] (4,-1.2) -- (4,1.2) node[xshift=4mm,yshift=-2mm]{$\bmC$};
        \draw[-latex] (0.7,0.866) .. controls (2,0)  .. (3.7,-0.7);
        \draw[-latex] (0.7,-0.866) .. controls (2,0)  .. (3.7,0.7);
        \filldraw[red] (4,0) circle (2pt);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


Now we will only concentrate on the lower ray i.e. $\{z\mid \Re(z)=0,\Im(z)\leq 0\}$. Now we want to  rotate this by $90^{\circ}$ clockwise to map it to the real axis by the conformal map $f_2(z)=-iz$. Hence $f_2(1)=-i$.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        %\filldraw[red!30!white] (-2,-1.5) -- (2,-1.5) -- (2,1.5) -- (-2,1.5)
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-1.5,0) -- (1.5,0);
        \draw[<-,very thin,red] (-1.5,0) -- (0,0) ;
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,-1.2) -- (0,1.2) ;
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Now we know $f_3(z)=\sqrt{z}$ maps the $\bbC\setminus$negative real axis to right half plane.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \filldraw[red!30!white,opacity=0.6] (0,2) -- (0,-2) -- (2,-2) -- (2,2);
        \draw (0.5,0) node[yshift=4mm,black]{$\Om$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,2) -- (0,-2);
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-2,0) -- (2,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Hence $f_3(-i)=e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}$. Hence at this stage $\infty $ is mapped to $e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}$. Now we have to map $e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}$ to $1$. This is achieved by conformal map of the form $f_4(z)=az+b$ where $a\in\bbR,b\in\bbC$, $b=b_1+ib_2$. Therefore $$f_4\lt(e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}\rt)=1\iff ae^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}+b=1\iff \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}(1-i)+b=\iff b_2=\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}},\ b_1=\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}-1$$
We can take $a=\sqrt{2}$, $b_1=0$ and $b_2=1$. then we have $f_4(z)=\sqrt{2}z+i$. Hence now $\infty$ is mapped to $1$

Now we will rotate the right half plane by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ counter clockwise to map it to upper half plane by the conformal map $f_5(z)=iz$
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \filldraw[red!30!white,opacity=0.6] (2,0) -- (-2,0) -- (-2,2) -- (2,2);
        \draw (0.5,0) node[yshift=4mm,black]{$\Om$};
        \draw[<->,very thin] (0,2) -- (0,-0.5);
        \draw[<->,very thin] (-2,0) -- (2,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Finally we use the map $f_6(z)=\frac{z-i}{z+i}$ which maps the upper half plane to the inside of unit disk. And also we have $f_6(i)=\infty$. Hence the final map $$f_6\circ f_5\circ f_4\circ f_3\circ f_2\circ f_1(z)$$ maps $\infty\to\infty$. and this map, maps the arc $|z|=1$, $y\geq 0$ on the outside of the unit circle so that the points at  $\infty$ correspond to each other

%Problem
\parinn The \textit{Jordan curve theorem} asserts that every Jordan curve in the plane determines exactly two regions. The notion of winding number leads to a quick proof of one part of the theorem, namely that the complement of a Jordan curve $\gamma$ has at least two components. This will be so if there exists a point $a$ with $n(\gamma, a) \neq 0$.

We may assume that $\Re (z)>0$ on $\gamma$, and that there are points $z_1$, $z_2 \in \gamma$ with $\Im (z_1)<0, \Im (z)_2>0$. These points may be chosen so that there are no other points of $\gamma$ on the line segments from 0 to $z_1$ and from 0 to $z_2$. Let $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ be the ares of $\gamma$ from $z_1$ to $z_2$ (excluding the end points).

Let $\sigma_1$ be the closed curve that consists of the line segment from 0 to $z_1$ followed by $\gamma_1$ and the segment from $z_2$ to 0 , and let $\sigma_2$ be constructed in the same way with $\gamma_2$ in the place of $\gamma_1$. Then $\sigma_1-\sigma_2=\gamma$ or $-\gamma$.

The positive real axis intersects both $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ (why?). Choose the notation so that the intersection $x_2$ farthest to the right is with $\gamma_2$ (Figure). Prove the following:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item $n\left(\sigma_1, x_2\right)=0$, hence $n\left(\sigma_1, z\right)=0$ for $z \epsilon \gamma_2$;
    \item $n\left(\sigma_1, x\right)=n\left(\sigma_2, x\right)=1$ for small $x>0$ (Lemma 2);
    \item the first intersection $x_1$ of the positive real axis with $\gamma$ lies on $\gamma_1$;
    \item $n\left(\sigma_2, x_1\right)=1$, hence $n\left(\sigma_2, z\right)=1$ for $z \epsilon \gamma_1$;
    \item there exists a segment of the positive real axis with one end point on $\gamma_1$, the other on $\gamma_2$, and no other points on $\gamma$. The points $x$ between the end points satisfy $n(\gamma, x)=1$ or -1 .

\end{problem}

\solve{
    %Solution
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item We claim that $x_2$ lies outside the curve $\sigma_1$. Indeed, consider the ray joining 0 and $x_2$. This ray can not intersect $\gamma$ beyond the point $x_2$ because $x_2$ is the farthest point. Thus the whole ray $\left(x_2, \infty\right)$ is contained in one region defined by the curve, but $\gamma$ must be bounded. Thus $x_2$ must lie in the unbounded region defined by $\sigma_1$.\parinn

              Now pick $z \in \gamma_2$. Then $x_2, z$ are path connected, hence they must lie in the same connected region of $\sigma_1$. Hence $n\left(\sigma_1, z\right)=n\left(\sigma_1, x_2\right)=0$

        \item Let $S:=\{z \mid z \in \gamma, z \in \mathbb{R}\}$. Since $S$ is compact we can pick the smallest element of $S$, considered as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, let's call it $x_1$. We claim that $n\left(\sigma_1, x\right)=n\left(\sigma_2, x\right)=0$ for $x \in\left(0, x_1\right)$. By Lemma 2 , it suffices to prove that $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ doesn't pass through any point to the left of $x_1$, which is obvious by the construction of $x$. Also, the path $z_1 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow z_2$ intersects the $X$-axis only at 0 .
        \item Suppose the first intersection $x_1$ of the positive real axis with $\gamma$ does not lie on $\gamma_1$; then it must lie on $\gamma_2$. In part (b) we proved that $n\left(\sigma_1, x\right)=0$ for $x \in\left(0, x_1\right)$. But now we can consider the path from $x$ to $x_1$ along the positive $X$-axis and then use the path along $\gamma_2$ from $x_1$ to $x_2$. Thus $x$ and $x_2$ are path-connected and both are in the same region of $\sigma_1$. But then $1=n\left(\sigma_1, x\right)=n\left(\sigma_1, x_2\right)=0$, where the first equality is from part (a) and the last equality is from part (b).
        \item Because $x_1$ lies on $\gamma_1$, again by applying Lemma 2, we get $n\left(\sigma_2, x_1\right)=1$. Again, because any $z \in \gamma_2$ is path-connected along $\gamma_2$, we must have $n\left(\sigma_2, z\right)=1$
        \item Consider the sets $S_1:=\left\{z \in \mathbb{R} \mid z \in \gamma_1\right\}$ and $S_2:=\left\{z \in \mathbb{R} \mid z \in \gamma_2\right\}$. Since $S_1$ and $S_2$ are compact we can find two points $a \in S_1, b \in S_2$ such that there is no point of $\gamma$ between $a$ and $b$, otherwise we can construct a sequence of points in $S_1$ or $S_2$ such that it converges to a point in another set. contradicting the fact that $S_1, S_2$ are closed and disjoint. Now pick point $x$ between $a$ and $b$. Let us assume $\gamma=\sigma_1-\sigma_2$. Then $n(\gamma, x)=n\left(\sigma_1, x\right)-n\left(\sigma_2, x\right)$. But $n\left(\sigma_1, x\right)=n\left(\sigma_1, b\right)=0$ by part (a) and $n\left(\sigma_2, x\right)=n\left(\sigma_1, a\right)=1$ by part (d).

\solve{
    %Solution
    We have $|dz|=-i\rho \frac{dz}{z}$. Therefore \begin{align*}
        \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{|dz|}{|z-a|^2} & = -i\rho \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{z|z-a|^2}= -i\rho \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{z(z-a)(\ovz-\ova)} \\
                                            & = -i\rho \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{(z-a)\lt(z\ovz-\ova z  \rt)}                                  \\
                                            & = -i\rho \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{(z-a)\lt(\frac{\rho^2}{z}z-\ova z\rt)}                        \\
                                            & = -i\rho \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{(z-a)\lt(\rho^2-\ova z\rt)}
    \end{align*}

    Now if $\rho < |a|$, then $|z-a|^2>0$. Hence the function $\frac1{(z-a)\lt(\rho^2-\ova z\rt)}$ is analytic and its integral  along $|z|=\rho$ is 0

    If $\rho > |a|$ then if $\rho^2\neq \ova z$ because if it is then \begin{align*}
        \rho^2\neq \ova z \iff |z| =\frac{\rho^2}{|a|} \iff \rho = \frac{\rho^2}{|a|} \iff |a|=\rho
    \end{align*} which is not possible. Hence $f(z)=\frac{1}{\rho^2-\ova z}$ is analytic in the $\rho$-disk. Hence $$\int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{\rho^2-\ova z}=0$$. Then by Cauchy's Integral Formula we have $$f(a)=\frac1{2\pi i}\int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{f(z)dz}{z-a}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{(z-a)\lt(\rho^2-\ova z\rt)} \iff $$ Therefore we have $$\int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{|dz|}{|z-a|^2} =-i\rho f(a)2\pi i=-i\rho \frac{2\pi i}{\rho^2-a\ova}=\frac{2\pi \rho}{\rho^2-a\ova}$$

              Then $z^n(1-z)^m$ is analytic on $\bbC$. Hence $$\int_{|z|=2} z^n(1-z)^m d z=0$$

              In this case we divide the closed curve $|z|=2$ into addition of two paths $\Gm_1$ and $\Gm_2$ where when $\Re(z)=\frac12$ $\Gm_1$ goes from lower half plane to upper half plane along the line $\Re(z)=\frac12$ and $\Gm_2$ does the opposite after that both paths follows the circle perimeter like in the figure

              Now $(1-z)^{-|m|}$ is analytic on $\Gm_1$. Hence $$\frac{2 \pi i}{(|n|-1) !}\frac{d^{|n|-1}}{dz^{|n|-1}}\lt.\frac{1}{(1-z)^{|m|}}  \rt|_{z=0}=\int_{\Gm_1}\frac1{(1-z)^{|m|}z^{|n|}}dz=\frac{(|m|+|n|-2)!}{(m|-1)!(|n|-1)!}2\pi i$$
              $z^{-|n|}$ is analytic on $\Gm_2$. Hence $$\frac{2 \pi i}{(|m|-1) !}(-1)^{|m|}\frac{d^{|m|-1}}{dz^{|m|-1}}\lt.\frac{1}{z^{|m|}}  \rt|_{z=1}=\int_{\Gm_2}\frac1{(1-z)^{|m|}z^{|n|}}dz=-\frac{(|m|+|n|-2)!}{(m|-1)!(|n|-1)!}2\pi i$$Hence$$\int_{|z|=2} z^n(1-z)^m d z=\int_{|z|=2} \frac{1}{(1-z)^{|m|}z^{|n|}} d z=0$$
        \item from Problem 10 we have $|dz|=-i\rho \frac{dz}{z}$. Therefore \begin{align*}
                  \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{|dz|}{|z-a|^4} & = -i\rho \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{z|z-a|^4}= -i\rho \int_{|z|=\rho}\frac{dz}{z(z-a)^2(\ovz-\ova)^2} \\

              \end{align*}\parinn

              Now if $\rho < |a|$, then $|z-a|^4>0$. Hence the function $\frac1{(z-a)^2\lt(\rho^2-\ova z\rt)^2}$ is analytic and its integral  along $|z|=\rho$ is 0\parinn

              If $\rho > |a|$ then if $\rho^2\neq \ova z$ because if it is then \begin{align*}

%Problem		
Prove that a function which is analytic in the whole plane and satisfies an inequality $|f(z)|<|z|^n$ for some $n$ and all sufficiently large $|z|$ reduces to a polynomial.

\end{problem}

\solve{
%Solution
Given $|f(z)|<|z|^n$. To show $f$ is a polynomial it is enough to show $\exs\ n\in\bbN$ such that $f^{(n)}(z)=0$. We have $$f^{(n)}(z)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{|s|=\rho}\frac{f(s)ds}{(s-z)^{n+1}}$$Now if $|z|>\rho$ then
\begin{align*}
    \lt|f^{(n+1)}(z)\rt| & \leq \frac{(n+1)!}{2\pi}\lt|\int_{|t|= \rho} \frac{f(t)}{(t-z)^{n+2}}dt   \rt|                              \\
                         & \leq \frac{(n+1)!}{2\pi}\int_{|t|=\rho} \frac{|f(t)|}{|t-z|^{n+2}}|dt|                                      \\
                         & \leq \frac{(n+1)!}{2\pi}\int_{|t|=\rho}\frac{|t|^n}{(|t|-|z|)^{n+2}}|dt|                                    \\
                         & \leq \frac{(n+1)!}{2\pi}\frac{\rho^n}{(\rho-|z|)^{n+2}}2\pi \rho =\frac{\rho^{n+1}(n+1)!}{(\rho-|z|)^{n+2}}
\end{align*}Hence as $|z|\to \infty$ and $\rho\to \infty$ we have $\frac{\rho^{n+1}(n+1)!}{(\rho-|z|)^{n+2}}\to 0$. Hence $$	\lt|f^{(n+1)}(z)\rt|\leq 0\iff f^{(n+1)}(z)=0$$Now if $|z|\leq \rho$ then $f$ has a maximum $M$  in that closed $\rho-$disk. Hence $$\lt|f^{(n+1)}(z)\rt| \leq \frac{M(n+1)!}{\rho^{n+1}}$$Now as $\rho\to \infty$, $\frac{(n+1)!}{\rho^{n+1}}\to 0$. Hence $$\lt|f^{(n+1)}(z)\rt|\leq 0\iff f^{(n+1)}(z)=0$$2

\textbf{\textit{Claim: }}$\lt|f^{(n)}(z)\rt|\leq (n+1)!e$

\textbf{\textit{Proof: }}Let for any $k\in \bbN$, $|z|= 1-\frac1k=r_k$. Then $$|f(z)|\leq \frac{1}{1-|z|}=\frac1{1-\frac1k}=k$$Then we have $$\lt|f^{(n)}(0)\rt|=\lt|\frac{n!}{2\pi }\int_{|z|=r_k}\frac{f(z)dz}{z^{n+1}}  \rt|\leq \frac{n!}{2\pi }\int_{|z|=r_k}\frac{|f(z)|}{|z|^{n+1}}|dz|\leq\frac{n!}{2\pi }\, \frac{k}{r_k^{n+1}}2\pi r_k=\frac{kn!}{\lt(1-\frac1k\rt)^{n+1}}=\frac{n!k^{n+2}}{(k-1)^{n+1}}$$Now taking $k=n+1$ we have $$\lt|f^{(n)}(0)\rt|\leq \frac{n!(n+1)^{n+2}}{n^{n+1}} =(n+1)!\frac{(n+1)^{n+1}}{n^{n+1}}=(n+1)!\lt(1+\frac1n\rt)^{n+1}\leq (n+1)!e$$

Hence we have the best estimate of $\lt|f^{(n)}(0)\rt|$ which is $\lt|f^{(n)}(0)\rt|\leq (n+1)!e$

Show that the successive derivatives of an analytic function at a point can never satisfy $\left|f^{(n)}(z)\right|>n ! n^n$. Formulate a sharper theorem of the same kind.

\solve{
%Solution
We have $$f^{(n)}(z)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{|s|=\rho}\frac{f(s)ds}{(s-z)^{n+1}}$$Hence $$\lt|f^{(n)}(z)\rt|=\lt|\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{|s|=\rho}\frac{f(s)ds}{(s-z)^{n+1}}  \rt|\leq \frac{n!}{2\pi}\int_{|s|=\rho}\lt|\frac{f(s)ds}{(s-z)^{n+1}}\rt|=\frac{n!}{2\pi}\int_{|s|=\rho}\frac{|f(s)|}{|s-z|^{n+1}}|ds|$$Since $f$ is continuous in the $\rho$-disk it is bounded by some value $M$. Therefore$$\lt|f^{(n)}(z)\rt|\leq \frac{n!}{2\pi}\int_{|s|=\rho}\frac{|f(s)|}{|s-z|^{n+1}}|ds|\leq \frac{n!}{2\pi}\int_{|s|=\rho}\frac{M}{|s-z|^{n+1}}|ds|\leq \frac{Mn!}{2\pi}\frac{1}{|\rho-z|^{n+1}}2\pi\rho=Mn!\frac{\rho}{|\rho-z|^{n+1}}$$Since $\rho>|z|$ we have $$\lt|f^{(n)}(z)\rt|\leq Mn!\frac{\rho}{|\rho-z|^{n+1}}\leq Mn!\frac{\rho}{(|\rho|-|z|)^{n+1}}\leq Mn!\frac{\rho}{(|\rho|)^{n+1}}=\frac{Mn!}{\rho^n}$$ Using the given inequality we have $$n!n^n<\lt|f^{(n)}(z)\rt|\leq \frac{Mn!}{\rho^n} \iff n!n^n<\frac{Mn!}{\rho^n}\iff (n\rho )^n<M$$ which is not possible as $n\to \infty$. Hence $f$ doesn't satisfy $\left|f^{(n)}(z)\right|>n ! n^n$
